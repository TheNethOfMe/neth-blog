<p>I’ve wanted to make a blog for awhile. Actually, I’ve wanted to make several blogs for awhile. There are a lot of different things I like to do, and it hasn’t always been easy to know what box to put things in. <!--more-->Do I throw my thoughts about video games into a tech blog or should those things be separated? Is it a good idea to put my personal opinions and my more professional posts?</p>

<p>To be honest, I still don’t have answers to those questions, but for now, I think I’m going to put everything here anyway. I have other web presences where my less professional opinions can live eventually, but I’m not much of a shock jock. I don’t think my opinions are that extreme (though others will probably disagree) and I’m not ashamed of any of them.</p>

<p>For this first entry, I’m not going to talk politics or hobbies (though I guess coding could be considered something of an hobby.) Instead I want to discuss my through process in putting this site together and why I made some of the decisions that I made.</p>

<p>If you got to this blog entry from the main site, and I pray that you did, you were probably greeted by a fun Tetris display full of pictures of screen shots of my projects and a few logos of things I like to use when I’m web developing. The Tetris pieces (sometimes called tetrominoes) are randomly generated and I designed to program to fit the pieces together as close as possible. The random Tetris piece program was something I developed quite some time ago with the intention of using it to display blog entries. I thought it would be a really fun way to display blog entries for a video game blog, but I was so proud of the program that I wanted to include it here as well.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that each square in each tetromino is made up of a table cell. The tetrominos are created by coloring cells in the table. At first, I had created the program to play text in each block that would include a shortened title (which would require two of the four squares per each tetromino) with a date and category in the other two. Each square would also get a click event attached linking it to the blog post it represents.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this produced a few problem. First of all, some tetrominoes are shaped in a way in which there’s a good way to read a blog title over two squares. It also required that a title be short enough to fit in two squares without making that cell wider. So I wouldn’t be able to put any long words in my title. But another, perhaps bigger problem, is the fact that it would be very hard to parse the information if you were using a screen reader. Tables aren’t always the most accessible piece of html to begin with, and forcing the user to need to read data across cells in inconsistent patters would be a nightmare. The only thing connecting the cells together would be color which would make it almost incomprehensible to colorblind folks.</p>

<p>It became clear that this would be a terrible way to display anything other than purely presentational components that don’t need to be read in a certain order. So I moved it from the blog or project area to the main area where the data within the cells would still make sense even if read in an order other than the one intended.</p>

<p>And speaking of purely presentational elements, let’s talk about carousels.</p>

<p>I wanted to make an animated component to the site to make it catch the eye a little more. But after doing a little research, I noticed something. Everyone thinks carousels are horrible and don’t belong anywhere on a website. And they have some very good reasons for this. It’s not easy to make these accessible. If you have a call to action anywhere in your slide show, it tends to get missed by most visitors. Some people mistake them for ads and just ignore them.</p>

<p>These were some good points, but I ultimately decided to include one anyway. I did this because my carousel doesn’t include a call to action. The information is purely presentation and doesn’t require any input by the user. There are no links, no calls to action.</p>

<p>One piece of advice I did take to heart was to ensure that the user could take control of the carousel at any point. By default, the slides change every ten seconds. But the user can pause that if they want and can change the slide at any time with the dots at the bottom of that section.</p>

<p>There are a few more components that change what’s on the page, but those were the primary two. I figured adding too many things to the main page might make it look too busy. I tried to separate the sections by fading them in and out as users scroll up and down the page.</p>

<p>That’s about all for now. Thank you all so much for reading and visiting my site. Hope you enjoy it and look for more stuff here in the future.</p>
